# Web-Traffic-Forecasting-Case-Study-
An end to end Machine Learning Case Study for predicting the number of views a web page can get in the future on the basis of its past viewed history.
Repository Contains the following file

###  1. EDA - EDA_WebTrafficForecasting.ipynb:
This ipynb contains the in-depth EDA for the given dataset. Kindly note that some of the plots might not be visible in the github page (plotly plots), which can be     viewed by opening the notebook using nbviewer.

###  2. Modelling_WebTrafficForecasting.ipynb
This notebook contains the detailed Feture Engineering and Modelling on the given dataset.

###  3. final_WebTrafficForecasting.ipynb:
This notebook contains the final pipeline, where the we can directly get the Predictions by just giving the inputs to the pipeline, which does all the pre-             processing and predictions by itself.

###  4. app.py
The web-app is deployed using REST API .
To view the final output of the code open cmd and type "run app.py" .
The model is currently deployed on aws and can be tested from the link: http://ec2-34-221-67-120.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com.
